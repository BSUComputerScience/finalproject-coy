# Star Wars Trivia

## **Author**: Jennifer Coy

**Project Summary**: This app will allow a Star Wars fan to look up trivia using the Star Wars API, SWAPI, which 
contains details about people, planets, and more.  Additionally, later features may use
the yoda or sith translator APIs.

**Target Audience And Need**: Star Wars fans, who happen to have a computer with this application installed
and prefer to use this API rather than googling the information.

**Key Features**:  Initially, this app will retrieve information about certain topics in the realm of Star Wars.  Later 
versions of the app may introduce yoda or sith translators, or even have a trivia quiz-style game.  Initially, these 
user stories are envisioned to be part of the app.
1. As a Star Wars fan, so that I can learn more about the films, I want to see information such as the date released and the opening crawl text.
2. As a Star Wars fan, so that I can learn more about planets like Tatooine, I want to see relevant information about the planet, such as the climate, population, and current residents of interest.
3. As a Star Wars fan, so that I can learn more about the species of creatures, I want to see information such as if the species is sentient, its average lifetime, and films that it has appeared in.

**Technology**:
This project will connect primarily to the SWAPI site listed first below.  Future versions may also contect to 
yoda and sith translater APIs also listed.  This application will be built using Java, JavaFX, gradle and use the 
object-oriented paradigm.
