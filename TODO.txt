1.	Write a test that verifies, using a saved .json response from the API, that a class similar to the RevisionParser class of the first project can parse the data out of the .json
a.	Write the equivalent of the RevisionParser class
2.	Write a test that verifies that the data can be stored in an object, similar to the to the Revision class of the first project.
a.	Write the equivalent of the Revision class.
3.	Write a test that verifies that, given a Revision-like object, it will format the contents into a string that is returned.
a.	Write the equivalent of the RevisionFormatter class
4.	Write a test that verifies that, give a sample query to the API, the response received from the API is correct
a.	Write the equivalent of the APIConnect class (connect to the API, receive the .json response)
b.	This test is only used during development of this object, then the @Test is removed
5.	Write a basic JavaFX (or console) Main, which will display the results of the query, using the classes developed above.
